# Pyramis library

This repository provides Pyramis, a Java library for quantitative modeling and analysis of **non-Markovian systems** specified as an **extension of UML statecharts**. Specifically: 
- Models can be defined as **Hierarchical Semi-Markov Processes with parallel regions (HSMPs)**, a class of statecharts capturing concurrency, hierarchy, stochastic timing, and probabilistic choices. In HSMPs, steps model activities with non-Markovian duration possibly with bounded support. Steps can be **simple steps**, modeling atomic activities, or **composite steps**, obtained by composition of concurrent **regions**. In turn, regions consist of steps, in a recursive composition yielding a **hierarchy** of HSMPs. 
- Models can be evaluated by a compositional technique that performs separate analysis of the Semi-Markov Process (SMP) underlying each region, supporting both evaluation of steady-state behaviour of stationary models and evaluation of transient behaviour of non-stationary models until absorption. 

The approach is presented in the paper titled "Compositional Analysis of Hierarchical UML Statecharts" authored by Laura Carnevali, Reinhard German, Francesco Santoni, and Enrico Vicario, currently submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering after a minor revision.

## Case study on transient timed failure logic analysis of component-based systems

This case study addresses Timed Failure Logic Analysis (TFLA) of a benchmark of component-based systems with increasing complexity. Specifically, starting from a basic pattern, a suite of synthetic models is generated by varying the behaviour length (i.e., the number of steps in sequential behaviours), the parallelism degree (i.e., the number of regions of each composite step), the hierarchy depth (i.e., the number of nested layers), the type of composite step (i.e., either type first, if the composite step terminates as soon as any of its regions terminates, or type last, if the composite step terminates when all its regions have terminated), the presence or absence of rare events, the type of duration distributions (i.e., expolynomial distributions with either small or large support), and the presence or absence of cycles.

### Derivation of ground truth (requires a time ranging from nearly 15 minutes for the base model to nearly 40 hours for the most complex model)

Execute the `main` method of `src/test/java/it/unifi/hierarchical/analysis/tse/trans/TFLGroundTruth.java` to derive a ground truth for each model of the suite except for the model variants with rare events, large-support distributions, and cycles. Execute the `main` method of `src/test/java/it/unifi/hierarchical/analysis/tse/trans/TFLRareGroundTruth.java`, `src/test/java/it/unifi/hierarchical/analysis/tse/trans/TFLLargeSupportGroundTruth.java`, and `src/test/java/it/unifi/hierarchical/analysis/tse/trans/TFLCyclesGroundTruth.java` to derive a ground truth for the model variants with rare events, large-support distributions, and cycles, respectively. Specifically: 
- The files containing the computation times and the probability of each step (before absorption) are placed in `src/main/resources/pyramisSimulation` for each model of the suite except for the model variants with rare events, large-support distributions, and cycles. The same files are placed in `src/main/resources/pyramisSimulationRare`, `src/main/resources/pyramisSimulationLong`, and `src/main/resources/pyramisSimulationCycles` for the model variants with rare events, large-support distributions, and cycles, respectively.
- The files containing the durations of the failure process are placed in `src/main/resources/groundTruthDistributions`. Execute the `main` method of `src/test/java/it/unifi/hierarchical/analysis/tse/trans/TFLDrawCDF.java` to translate each of these files into a file that represents the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the failure process (used for the plots in Fig. 7) and is placed in `src/main/resources/groundTruthCDF`.

### Evaluation of accuracy and complexity (requires a time ranging from nearly 3.5 minutes for the base model to nearly 45 hours for the most complex model)

Execute the `main` method of `src/test/java/it/unifi/hierarchical/analysis/tse/trans/TFLAnalysis.java` to run the analysis of each model of the suite, except for the model variants with rare events, large-support distributions, and cycles. For each of these models, 100 simulation runs are also performed, with each run lasting at least as long as the analysis. 

Execute the `main` method of `src/test/java/it/unifi/hierarchical/analysis/tse/trans/TFLRareAnalysis.java`, `src/test/java/it/unifi/hierarchical/analysis/tse/trans/TFLLargeSupportAnalysis.java`, and `src/test/java/it/unifi/hierarchical/analysis/tse/trans/TFLCyclesAnalysis.java`  to run the analysis of the model variants with rare events, large-support distributions, and cycles. Also in this case, for each of these models, 100 simulation runs are also performed, with each run lasting at least as long as the analysis. 

The files contaning the analysis computation times (reported in Table 1 and Fig. 5) and the probability of each step (before absorption) produced by the analysis for each model of the suite except for the model variants with rare events, large-support distributions, and cycles are placed in `src/main/resources/pyramisAnalytic`. The same files produced by the analysis for the model variants with rare events, large-support distributions, and cycles are placed in`src/main/resources/pyramisAnalyticRare`, `src/main/resources/pyramisAnalyticLong`, and `src/main/resources/pyramisAnalyticCycles`, respectively. 

Similarly, the same files produced by the 100 simulation runs are placed in `src/main/resources/pyramisAnalyticSameTime` for each model of the suite except for the model variants with rare events, large-support distributions, and cycles, and they are placed in `src/main/resources/pyramisAnalyticSameTimeRare`, `src/main/resources/pyramisAnalyticSameTimeLong`, and `src/main/resources/pyramisAnalyticSameTimeCycles` for the model variants with rare events, large-support distributions, and cycles, respectively.

Execute the `main` method of `src/test/java/it/unifi/hierarchical/analysis/tse/trans/TFLAnalysisAccuracy.java` to compare the analysis results with the ground truth for each model except for the variant with cycles and execute `src/test/java/it/unifi/hierarchical/analysis/tse/trans/TFLCyclesAnalysisAccuracy.java` to compare the analysis results with the ground truth for the model variant with cycles, obtaining mean value and standard deviation of relative errors of analysis over simple steps (reported in Table 2 and Fig. 6). The files containing the relative error for each step are placed in `src/main/resources/PyramisResSameTime` for each model except for the variants with rare events, large-support distributions, and cycles. The same files are placed in `src/main/resources/PyramisResSameTimeRare`, `src/main/resources/PyramisResSameTimeLong`, `src/main/resources/PyramisResSameTimeCycles` for the model variants with rare events, large-support distributions, and cycles, respectively.

Execute the `main` method of `src/test/java/it/unifi/hierarchical/analysis/tse/trans/TFLSimulationAccuracy.java` to compare the simulation results with the ground truth, obtaining average (over 100 simulation runs) mean value and standard deviation of relative errors of simulation over simple steps (reported in Table 3 and Fig. 6).

Execute the `main` method of `java/it/unifi/hierarchical/analysis/tse/steady/SWRejAnalysisFixedTicks.java` to run the analysis with fixed time tick for all the steps of the model, execute the `main` method of and `java/it/unifi/hierarchical/analysis/tse/steady/SWRejAnalysisVariableTicks.java` to run the analysis with different time tick for different steps of the model. The files contaning the analysis computation times (reported in Table 7) and the steady-state probability of each step are placed in `src/main/resources/pyramis`.

Execute the `main` method of `java/it/unifi/hierarchical/analysis/tse/steady/SWRejSimulation.java` to run, for each analysis with variable time tick, 100 simulation runs of the model, with each run lasting at least as long as the analysis. The files containing the steady-state probability of each step are placed in `src/main/resources/pyramisSameTime`.

Execute the `main` method of `java/it/unifi/hierarchical/analysis/tse/steady/SWRejAnalysisAccuracy.java` to compare the analysis results with the ground truth, obtaining, for each step, the relative error achieved by the analysis with respect to the ground truth (reported in Table 8 and Fig. 10). The files are placed in `src/main/resources/pyramisCaseStudyRes`.

Execute the `main` method of `java/it/unifi/hierarchical/analysis/tse/steady/SWRejSimulationAccuracy.java` to compare the simulation results with the ground truth, obtaining, for each step, the mean value and standard deviation (over 100 runs) of relative errors achieved by the simulation with respect to the ground truth (reported in Table 9 and Fig. 10).The files are placed in `src/main/resources/pyramisResSameTime`.
